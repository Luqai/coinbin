Hi,

I have been mining for a couple of days now and until now my address has not been showing in the workers stats. Can someone please help me?
The address I used to mine with is: 

BTG-nVidia.miner.0.3.4b
miner --server eu.pool.gold --user GL9x6oiKPvs7WFsUq48JX5SP4AFBvvFxzt.Luqai --pass x --port 3044

Thanks in advance!
